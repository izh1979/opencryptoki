.SH NAME
pkcscca \- configuration utility for the CCA token

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpkcscca\fP
[\fB-h\fP]
[\fB-m v2objectsv3\fP]
[\fIOPTIONS\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpkcscca\fP utility assists in administering the CCA token. Currently it
migrates opencryptoki version 2 private token objects to the encryption
method used in opencryptoki version 3.

In verion 2 of opencryptoki, CCA private token objects were encrypted in CCA
hardware. In version 3 these objects are encrypted in software. The
\fBv2objectsv3\fP migration option migrates these version 2 objects by
decrypting them in CCA hardware using a secure key and then re-encrypting
them in software using a software key. Afterwards, v2 objects can be accessed
in version 3.
